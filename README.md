# VBA Challenge Project

## Overview

This project is part of the VBA Challenge, where the goal was to automate the analysis of stock data over multiple quarters using VBA (Visual Basic for Applications). The script loops through stock data for each quarter, calculates various metrics, and identifies the stocks with the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease, and greatest total volume.

## Features

The script includes the following features:

- **Loop through quarterly stock data**: The script processes data from each quarter to calculate the following for each stock:
  - **Ticker Symbol**
  - **Quarterly Change**: The difference between the opening price at the beginning of the quarter and the closing price at the end.
  - **Percentage Change**: The percentage change from the opening price to the closing price.
  - **Total Stock Volume**: The total volume of stock traded during the quarter.
- **Identify Key Metrics**: The script identifies and outputs the following key metrics:
  - **Greatest Percentage Increase**
  - **Greatest Percentage Decrease**
  - **Greatest Total Volume**

## How to Run the Script

1. Open Excel and press `Alt + F11` (or `Fn + Option + F11` on a Mac) to open the VBA editor.
2. Copy the VBA script into a new module.
3. Run the script to process the stock data and output the results.

## Dependencies

- **Microsoft Excel**: The script is written in VBA and runs within Excel.

## Project Structure

- **VBA_Challenge**: This folder contains the Excel files used for the challenge.
- **Script**: The VBA script that automates the data analysis.
- **Results**: The output data generated by the script.

## Acknowledgments

### Previous Code

This project builds upon code previously submitted as part of the VBA Challenge. The initial version of the script was used as a foundation for further improvements and optimizations.

### Assistance from ChatGPT

During the development process, assistance was provided by ChatGPT, a language model developed by OpenAI. ChatGPT was used to help fix prior mistakes in the code, such as:

- Correcting percentage calculations to ensure accurate results.
- Formatting output values correctly to display them in the expected format.
- Improving the script's logic to identify and display the greatest percentage increase, decrease, and total volume.

The collaboration with ChatGPT allowed for efficient troubleshooting and code refinement, ensuring that the final script met the project requirements.
